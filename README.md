# Note Taking Application

## Description

I was motivated to create this application as a simple, easy and efficient way to keep track of notes and tasks. I built this because I wanted an app that was integrated into the browser, that I could take notes on, without leaving to a different app. It solves the problem of being able to conveniently take notes and access them on any other device with internet. I learned a lot more about Node JS and more importantly, routing within Express.JS.  

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (Express & UUID) via "npm init" in the command line
- Run "node server.js" in the command line

## Usage

Here is a link to the deployed application:


Here are a few screenshots of the app functionality:
